Error: [BABEL]: --- PLACEHOLDER PACKAGE ---
This @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object version is not meant to
be imported. Something is importing
@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object without declaring it in its
dependencies (or devDependencies) in the package.json file.
Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to your devDependencies
to work around this error. This will make this message go away.
